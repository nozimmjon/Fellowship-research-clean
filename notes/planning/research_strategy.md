# Research Strategy: Intergenerational Educational Mobility in Uzbekistan

## 1) Frozen Paper Question
"How persistent is educational attainment across generations in Uzbekistan, how has that persistence changed from 2010 to 2022-23, and which household and regional factors are associated with higher mobility?"

## 2) Contribution Statement
This paper provides reproducible multi-wave evidence on intergenerational educational mobility in Uzbekistan using LiTS 2010, 2016, and 2022-23. It documents national trends and subgroup differences and relates mobility to household and regional correlates, while treating pandemic-era child-learning evidence as suggestive rather than causal.

## 3) Final Paper Architecture

### Module A (Core)
- National and subgroup mobility estimates from LiTS 2010, 2016, 2022-23.
- Locked measure set: rank-rank slope, transition matrix, upward mobility, downward mobility, persistence.

### Module B (Core)
- Correlates of mobility with fixed effects and locked core covariates.
- Conditional additions only if coverage/information thresholds pass.

### Module C (Short Extension)
- 2022-23 LiTS IV mechanism section using child-learning/device/support variables.
- Explicitly labeled as suggestive heterogeneity evidence.

### Conditional Module (Archived; Not Implemented in Frozen Repo)
- No baseline DiD or event-study specification is included in the frozen repository.

## 4) Final Sample Rules
- Respondents aged 25-64.
- Cohorts fixed to: 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64.
- One respondent-level observation per LiTS record.
- Weighted estimates in descriptive tables and regressions.
- Subgroup outputs suppressed when valid `N < 30`.

## 5) Canonical Variable Plan

### Core variables (main paper)
- `wave_year`
- `own_years_schooling`
- `parent_years_schooling`
- `own_ed_level`
- `parent_ed_level`
- `region`
- `urban`
- `gender`
- `cohort`

### Conditional Module B variables
- `hh_income_proxy`
- `migration_exposure`
- `multigenerational_hh`

## 6) Harmonization Rules
- Education categories are locked as:
  - `no_formal`, `primary`, `lower_secondary`, `upper_secondary`, `post_secondary_non_tertiary`, `tertiary`
- Parent proxy for category analysis:
  - Main spec: `parent_ed_level = max(father_ed_level, mother_ed_level)`
  - Robustness: averaged ordered parent score
- Primary cross-wave comparisons are rank-based.
- Rank-rank slope is estimated with within-wave education ranks from monotone parent/child scores.

## 7) Locked Equation Set

### Eq. 1: Wave-Specific Rank-Rank Slope
`R_own(i,w) = alpha_w + beta_w * R_parent(i,w) + e(i,w)`

### Eq. 2: Pooled Persistence with Wave Interactions
`R_own(i) = alpha + beta*R_parent(i) + theta2016*(R_parent(i)*D2016) + theta2022*(R_parent(i)*D2022) + gamma'X(i) + region_FE + cohort_FE + wave_FE + e(i)`

### Eq. 3: Attainment Score Correlates
`S_own(i) = alpha + beta*S_parent(i) + gamma'X(i) + region_FE + cohort_FE + wave_FE + e(i)`

### Eq. 4: Upward Mobility Model
`Up(i) = alpha + sum_k beta_k * 1(parent_level(i)=k) + gamma'X(i) + region_FE + cohort_FE + wave_FE + e(i)`

### Eq. 5: Persistence Heterogeneity
`Persist(i) = alpha + beta*S_parent(i) + d1*(S_parent(i)*Urban(i)) + d2*(S_parent(i)*Female(i)) + d3*(S_parent(i)*D2022) + region_FE + cohort_FE + wave_FE + e(i)`

### Eq. 6: LiTS IV Mechanism Model (2022-23 only)
`logit(Pr(M(i)=1)) = alpha + beta*LowParentEdu(i) + eta*Urban(i) + phi*Male(i) + kappa*(LowParentEdu(i)*Urban(i)) + region_FE + e(i)`

### Eq. 7: HBS Supplemental Model (Appendix-only, conditional)
Run only if parent-child linkage diagnostics are adequate.

## 8) Estimation and Language Rules
- Weighted estimation throughout.
- Robust standard errors clustered at PSU if retained; otherwise clustered at region.
- Suppress subgroup outputs for `N < 30`.
- No causal verbs in Modules A and B.
- For Module C use: "associated with", "more likely", "suggestive evidence".

2. Week 2: build mobility measures and national trend outputs.
3. Week 3: subgroup and regional outputs plus core figures.
4. Week 4: correlates models and mechanism section finalization.
5. Week 5: integrate HBS/admin context and draft full text.
6. Week 6: tighten identification language, finalize appendix, produce publication pack.
